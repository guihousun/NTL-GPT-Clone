# `ntl-download` MCP

`ntl-download` is a local, single-user stdio MCP service for synchronous Google
Earth Engine raster exports and official NASA Earthdata VNP46A1/VNP46A2 daily mosaics.
It is intentionally separate from `ntl-gis-core`: the latter remains a
network-independent local GIS and nighttime-light analysis service.

Long downloads keep the MCP call open. They emit progress notifications and
write sanitized manifests under the selected output directory. There is no web
service, database, task queue, or remote account system.

## Install and configure

Install the package once in `NTL-GPT-Stable`:

```powershell
C:\Users\27334\miniconda3\Scripts\conda.exe run -n NTL-GPT-Stable python -m pip install -e D:\NTL-GPT-main\packages\ntl_toolkit
```

Codex configuration:

```toml
[mcp_servers.ntl-download]
command = "C:/Users/27334/miniconda3/Scripts/conda.exe"
args = ["run", "-n", "NTL-GPT-Stable", "python", "D:/NTL-GPT-main/mcp_servers/download_server.py"]
env = { NTL_MCP_WORKDIR = "D:/NTL-GPT-data", NTL_MCP_ENV_FILE = "D:/NTL-GPT-main/.env" }
```

For another checkout or Conda installation, replace the two paths. Keep
credentials in the local dotenv file or process environment, never in the MCP
configuration or tool arguments.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `validate_download_environment` | Checks local download dependencies, Earthdata token presence, and optional non-interactive GEE initialization. |
| `download_gee_raster` | Exports one explicit GEE image or collection reduction from a dataset, band, UTC dates, WGS84 bounding box, scale, CRS, and output path. |
| `download_vnp46a2_official_h5_country` | Plans or runs the official VNP46A2 non-gap-filled HDF5 country workflow: boundaries, CMR, download, validation, mosaic, audit, and optional package. |
| `download_vnp46a1_official_h5` | Plans or runs official VNP46A1 HDF5 retrieval for exactly one country or WGS84 BBox, producing daily `DNB_At_Sensor_Radiance_500m` GeoTIFFs and optional `UTC_Time` companion GeoTIFFs. |
| `inspect_download_run` | Reads a VNP46A1 or VNP46A2 audit when available; during an active run, returns its persisted status, current phase, completed phases, and last update time. |

The service also publishes `ntl://download/capabilities` and the shared
`ntl://schemas/result-v1` resource.

## Credential and path rules

- GEE uses credentials already authorized in the local Earth Engine runtime.
  `ntl-download` never runs OAuth. Use EasyGEE's environment/auth tools if
  `validate_download_environment(initialize_gee=true)` reports a setup error.
- The official HDF5 route reads `EARTHDATA_TOKEN` by default. It reports only
  whether that variable is configured; token values are redacted from manifests
  and tool results.
- Relative paths resolve below `NTL_MCP_WORKDIR`; absolute Windows paths are
  accepted. Partially-qualified paths such as `D:output.tif` are rejected.
- GEE output names are reserved with a numeric suffix instead of overwriting an
  existing GeoTIFF. VNP46A2 runs retain their manifests to support retry.

## Progress, recovery, and audit

The GEE tool reports initialization, imagery selection, export, validation, and
completion. The official HDF5 routes report each pipeline phase plus sanitized
script output and persist `*_runtime.json` state files. If the client does not
render progress notifications, call `inspect_download_run` on the same run
directory: before audit it reports `running`, the current phase, completed
phases, and last update time; after audit it returns the exact recovery targets.
An active or failed runtime state takes precedence over a stale audit from an
earlier attempt in the same directory.
For a long active call, a second local stdio client may inspect the same run
directory without creating a service, queue, or database.

For VNP46A2, `retry_download` and `not_processed` entries are returned as exact
`ISO3:YYYY-MM-DD` retry targets. `downloaded_without_mosaic` entries are
returned separately for a mosaic-only retry. `no_granules` is an availability
state, not a transport error. Do not declare a run complete while the audit
contains `downloaded_without_mosaic`, `retry_download`, `not_processed`, or
`other_manifest_status`.

Use this official HDF5 route only for explicit raw country-scale daily
non-gap-filled `DNB_BRDF_Corrected_NTL` rasters. For country statistics,
long-series summaries, and many-feature comparisons, use GEE server-side
reductions instead of downloading country rasters.

For VNP46A1, provide exactly one of `countries=["ISR"]` or
`bbox=[34.0,29.0,35.0,30.0]`. Its primary output is at-sensor radiance, not
VNP46A2 BRDF-corrected light. Set `include_utc_time=true` only when validating
UTC acquisition timing near a date boundary; it creates a separate decimal UTC
hours raster and must never be interpreted as radiance.

## Troubleshooting

- `GEE_NOT_INITIALIZED`: run EasyGEE environment/auth planning, complete the
  browser authorization locally if needed, then retry the MCP tool.
- `EARTHDATA_TOKEN_MISSING`: set or refresh the token in the dotenv file named
  by `NTL_MCP_ENV_FILE`, then restart the MCP client.
- `VNP46A2_AUDIT_INCOMPLETE`: call `inspect_download_run`, use its exact retry
  targets, run the required phase, then audit again.
- No server response or malformed protocol: start only through the stdio launcher;
  ordinary diagnostic output must not be written to stdout before MCP starts.
