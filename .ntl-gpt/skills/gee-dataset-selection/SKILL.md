# GEE Dataset Selection

Use this skill before writing a GEE plan or script when the task depends on dataset choice, band choice, temporal coverage, spatial scale, or auxiliary layers.

## Operating Rule

1. Read `/skills/gee-dataset-selection/references/dataset-selection-rules.md`.
2. Read `/skills/gee-dataset-selection/references/gee-dataset-registry.json` only for the dataset family needed by the task.
3. Before event/daily/recent-date work, run the latest-availability gate:
   - Preferred: call `dataset_latest_availability_tool`.
   - GEE path: validate selected `dataset_id`, bands, and latest `system:time_start` with `dataset_latest_availability_tool` or `GEE_dataset_metadata_tool`.
   - NASA LAADS path: validate the LAADS/CMR short_name has granules through the requested date with `dataset_latest_availability_tool` or the official pipeline query step.
4. Validate the selected `dataset_id` and bands with `GEE_dataset_metadata_tool` when the plan will execute in GEE.
5. If the selected dataset is unsupported or not yet updated for the requested date, choose a documented alternative, adjust the analysis window with user-visible justification, or return a clear coverage/latency error.
6. Treat dataset metadata as evidence-scoped: prefer entries with `validation_status: task_tested`, but still validate live band/date coverage for the exact task.

## Registry Scope

The registry is curated for NTL-Claw, not a full Earth Engine catalog. It covers:

- NTL products: annual, monthly, daily, legacy DMSP.
- Administrative boundaries: geoBoundaries, project China assets, GAUL/LSIB fallback.
- Population/electrification support: LandScan, WorldPop, GPW, GHSL population.
- Environmental covariates: MODIS NDVI/EVI/NPP, land cover, WorldCover, DEM.
- Event context: fire and flood context layers.

Auxiliary entries such as LandScan, GHSL, WorldPop, WorldCover, FIRMS, and Global Flood Database were live metadata checked and smoke tested on 2026-04-23; use their registry `live_validation` notes, and re-check exact AOI/date coverage before execution.

## Contract

Every GEE handoff should state:

- selected `dataset_id`
- selected `band`
- `date_range` with end-exclusive convention for scripts
- `scale_m`
- reducer and aggregation parameters
- why this dataset fits the task
- known caveats and fallback dataset

For common GEE parameter meanings, read:

- `/skills/gee-dataset-selection/references/gee-parameter-glossary.md`

For recent-event availability checks, run or adapt:

- `dataset_latest_availability_tool`
- `/skills/gee-dataset-selection/scripts/check_latest_availability.py`

Minimum output required before execution:

- `gee.latest_date` for the selected GEE collection, when using GEE.
- `gee.latest_period` for annual/monthly products. Treat `latest_date` there as the
  period anchor (`2024-01-01` means the 2024 annual composite, not "only through
  January 1, 2024").
- `laads.latest_day` for the selected LAADS/CMR short_name, when using official NASA granules.
- `requested_end_date`.
- `coverage_status`: `available`, `not_yet_available`, `unknown`, or `not_applicable`.
- `decision`: proceed, use fallback product, shrink/shift window, or report latency.
