# Source Conflict and Timeline

1. Preserve raw source assertions and timestamps before normalization.
2. Group likely duplicate reports using explicit identifiers, time/place tolerance, and event attributes; record the rule used.
3. Separate event time from publication and retrieval time, and retain timezone conversions.
4. Mark agreements, conflicts, missing coverage, and unresolved uncertainty without majority-vote erasure.
5. Return `EVENT_SOURCE_CONFLICT` when a disagreement materially affects the downstream window or AOI; NTL_Engineer decides whether limited analysis may continue.
